# Week 1 – Getting Started with Cybersecurity & GitHub

**Date:** April 12, 2025  
**Focus:** Learning GitHub, organizing my cybersecurity journey.

## What I Did
- Created my first GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop
- Learned how commits, pushes, and repositories work
- Wrote this journal entry to track my progress

## What I Learned
- GitHub is not as confusing as I thought—commits are like saving versions
- Pushing is just sending those changes to the online repo
- Using GitHub will help me build proof of work, showcase my skills,
  and serve as an easy way to document/keep track of my progress

## Tools I Used
- GitHub Desktop
- Notepad++

## Next Steps
- Start TryHackMe beginner rooms
- Write notes for each room in markdown and push them here
- Eventually try some malware labs or blue team challenges
